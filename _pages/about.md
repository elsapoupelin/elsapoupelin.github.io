I am a first-year PhD candidate at the Centre d'économie de la Sorbonne (CES) and the Sorbonne School of Economics under the co-supervision of <a href="https://leamarchal.fr">Léa Marchal</a> (CES, Paris 1) and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/valettejerome/home">Jérôme Valette</a> (CEPII).

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My research focuses on how institutions shape identities, belonging, and inequalities. I explore how political and economic frameworks influence the way groups interact, how collective identities are formed, and how these dynamics affect outcomes such as wages, social cohesion, and nation-building. By connecting insights from labor markets, local politics, and historical contexts, my work highlights the long-term role of institutions in shaping both economic disparities and social integration. My research sits at the intersection of political economy, labor economics and migration economics.
